/**
 * MINI-PROJECT 4: Daemon Thread Experiment
 *
 * Goal:
 * Understand the difference between daemon and worker threads.
 *
 * Task:
 * - Create a daemon thread that prints a message every second
 * - Do NOT block the main thread
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * - JVM shutdown rules
 * - Daemon threads do not keep JVM alive
 *
 * Expected Outcome:
 * - JVM exits even if daemon thread is still running
