/**
 * MINI-PROJECT 2: Runnable vs Thread
 *
 * Goal:
 * Understand why implementing Runnable is preferred over extending Thread.
 *
 * Task:
 * - Create one thread by extending Thread
 * - Create another thread by implementing Runnable
 * - Assign names to both threads
 * - Start both and print their names
 *
 * Key Questions:
 * - What do you lose by extending Thread?
 * - What is the difference between "task" and "execution mechanism"?
 *
 * Expected Outcome:
 * - Clear separation between business logic (Runnable)
 *   and execution (Thread)
