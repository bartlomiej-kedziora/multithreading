/**
 * MINI-PROJECT 3: OS Scheduling Illusion
 *
 * Goal:
 * Experience non-deterministic execution order caused by OS scheduling.
 *
 * Task:
 * - Start 5 threads
 * - Each thread prints numbers from 1 to 5
 * - Run the program multiple times
 *
 * Key Concept:
 * - Thread start order does NOT guarantee execution order
 *
 * Expected Outcome:
 * - Accept that concurrency is inherently non-deterministic
