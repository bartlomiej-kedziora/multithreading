What does RUNNABLE mean in Java?,A thread is either running on CPU or ready to run. It does NOT guarantee actual execution.
Which thread type prevents JVM shutdown?,A non-daemon (worker) thread keeps the JVM alive.
What does Thread.join() do?,It blocks the calling thread until the target thread finishes execution.
Why is extending Thread usually discouraged?,Because it prevents inheritance and mixes task logic with execution.
Who schedules Java threads?,Both the JVM and the operating system.
Does thread start order guarantee execution order?,No. Execution order is controlled by the OS scheduler.
What happens if only daemon threads remain?,The JVM exits immediately.
What is the main responsibility of Runnable?,To represent a unit of work without controlling execution.
Is RUNNABLE the same as running?,No. RUNNABLE includes both running and ready-to-run states.
What does join() NOT require?,Shared state or locks.
